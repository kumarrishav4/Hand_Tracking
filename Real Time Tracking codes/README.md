<h1>Real Time Tracking</h1>

<p>The project files focus on developing hand gesture tracking using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. An iterative approach was employed, with each file building on the previous ones to enhance functionality. The files also output a CSV containing the angles between fingers detected during movement.</p>
